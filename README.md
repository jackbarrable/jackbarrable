- 👋 Hi, I’m @jackbarrable
- 🌱 I used to code ~10 years ago for 'powerbot', utilising Java and the 'powerbot' library. I was only 13 at the time, so I'm currently trying to bring myself back up to speed after a long break to attain A Levels, a Masters in Mechanical Engineering and my first job as a graduate Solution Architect. 
- ⭐ I'm interested in developing my skills and knowledge across a wider range of programming languages by building out my own projects and starting my own repository/portfolio.
- 🌍 You can reach me via Github
